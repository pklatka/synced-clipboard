# Synced clipboard
Cross-platform synchronized clipboard. 

## Features
1. Desktop to mobile clipboard sync (images and text).
2. Mobile to desktop clipboard sync (only text, see [this](https://github.com/pklatka/synced-clipboard/blob/main/mobile/utils/clipboardManager.ts) for more details).
3. Everything works in local network, so you don't need to turn on bluetooth or have internet connection 😎

## Notes
1. To sync clipboard, mobile app instance has to run in foreground, right now background sync is not supported.
